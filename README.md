# matrex

[MAJIC]/MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT for JOINING THE CLUB: Matrex is a vectorial spreadsheet with the same functionalities of a classic spreadsheet application but in a new, different way. 

Matrex is excellent when working with blocks of data coming from databases, feeds, files, external applications, simulations. 


The most recent sources "AS IT IS:" are contained in the Matrex Subversion repository in https://matrex.sourceforge.net/. 

However, this project is a long time dead. Much before modern itime.
