**[MAJIC]/MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT** for JOINING THE CLUB: 

Matrex is a vectorial spreadsheet with the same functionalities of a classic spreadsheet application but in a new, different way. As this, Matrex is a tool to show, organize and [re]calculate calcs on complex data in such tabbulated environments as spreadsheets. 

"Comparing it with spreadsheets, it is specially suitable to complex calculations, for example to test and use mathematical
models and for other statistical, engineering, physical, and generally scientific calculations.

The idea that originated Matrex is that a typical spreadsheet is logically formed by:
- vectors (columns or rows of the spreadsheet)
- matrices
- scalars like results of aggregate operations (sums, averages), parameters and constants.

So, instead of reducing everything to cells of a spreadsheet, Matrex handles vectors,
matrices and scalars for what they are, under the general concept of Matrex “matrices”: a
matrix is an homogeneous rectangular block of numbers, texts, dates or booleans, which
can also be composed only by a column or by a single element."

Matrex is excellent when working with blocks of data coming from databases, feeds, files, external applications, simulations. 

The most recent sources "AS IT IS:" are contained in the Matrex Subversion repository in https://matrex.sourceforge.net/. 

However, this project is a long time dead. Much before modern itime.
